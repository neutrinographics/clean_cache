Designed for use in projects that follow [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) pattern,
data_cache is a simple cache abstraction allowing you to easily mock it for unit tests.

## Features

Several prebuilt cache are included:

* Memory cache
* Hive cache
* Hybrid cache

If you need something specific, you just need to implement the `LocalCache` abstraction.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
